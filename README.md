# CRUD Operations Project
Employee Management System – CRUD Project
The Employee Management System is a Spring Boot-based RESTful application designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee data. It serves as a backend service where clients (like frontend apps or tools like Postman) can interact via HTTP requests to manage records of employees such as their name, email, phone number, and ID. The system follows standard MVC architecture, ensuring separation of concerns across controller, service, and repository layers.

Project Requirements & Functionalities:-
This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application for managing employee records.

Functionalities:
1.Add a new employee
2.View all employees
3.View employee by ID
4.Update existing employee details
5.Delete an employee

Technologies & Concepts Used:-
1.Java
2.Spring Boot (REST API)
3.Spring Data JPA
4.Lombok
5.H2/MySQL Database
6.Maven (Project management)
7.BeanUtils (for object copying)
8.Dependency Injection

Explanation:
EmpController.java: Handles all REST endpoints for the application.
Employee.java: Data Transfer Object used for API communication.
EmployeeEntity.java: Annotated with JPA to represent the Employee table in the database.
EmployeeRepository.java: Extends JpaRepository to provide basic CRUD operations.
EmployeeService: Defines business methods like create, read, update, delete.
EmployeeServiceImpl: Implements the service methods using repository.

Summary:-
This project demonstrates a complete backend system using Spring Boot for basic employee management. It emphasizes separation of concerns (Controller-Service-Repository layers), uses standard RESTful practices, and integrates with a relational database via Spring Data JPA.

This kind of project is great for learning and demonstrating:
REST API development
CRUD operations 
Best practices for Spring Boot applications
